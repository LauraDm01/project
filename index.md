More than 2 million people are infected with resistant bacteria in the United States alone, causing more than 23,000 deaths a year [1]. It is an evergrowing problem and it is predicted that by 2050, antibiotic resistance will account for 10 million deaths worldwide.
Strategies for new antibiotics include screening microorganisms as well as synthetic approaches, but antibiotic resistance is spreading faster than the introduction of new compunds. Because antibacterial defense mechanisms are the result of evolutionary nature, they may already exist in nature, even before the introduction of an antibiotic [2,1]. Soon after a new antibiotic is discovered, clinical resistance is observed[3]. In most cases, this occurs after a few years, and in some few rare instances, it takes decades for significant resistance to develop [2]. Characterizing when and how antibiotic resistance evolves could provide valuable information for the development of new drugs, and how they should be administered [3].
